## üî• News
* **`2024.06.15`** üåü We have refreshed our evaluation: 1) replace broken and potentially broken video links, and re-annotated them; 2) GPT-4o now samples 384 frames (previously 10 from the website) at 512x512 resolution, boosting overall accuracy to 71.9%.
* **`2024.06.03`** üåü We are very proud to launch MME-RealWorld, the first-ever comprehensive evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video Analysis!



## üëÄ MME-RealWorld Overview

Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leading to large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations, resulting in significant model bias; 3) restricted data sources, often overlapping with existing benchmarks and posing a risk of data leakage; 4) insufficient task difficulty and discrimination, especially the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce <strong>MME-RealWorld</strong>. Initially, we collect more than **300K** images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering **13K** high-quality images for data annotation. With the participation of professional **25** annotators and **7** researchers, we annotate **29K** question-answer pairs that cover **43** subtasks across five real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving **28** prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that existing models perform poorly in multiple real-world tasks, and there is a significant gap among different models. We hope that MME-RealWorld will further inspire the research community to improve and evolve this field. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through five key features:

* ***Scale, Diversity, and Real-World Utility.*** Our image themes cover $6$ key domains and $14$ sub-class images, offering a highly diverse set of images. Our $43$ sub-class tasks are all closely related to real-world specific tasks, providing high practical value and making it the largest fully human-annotated MLLM benchmark.
    
* ***Quality.*** (1) *Image Resolution.* Many image details contain important information, such as a scoreboard in a sports event. Only with high-resolution images can such critical details be understood, providing the expected assistance to humans. (2) *Annotation.* All annotations are completed manually, with 7 experts cross-checking the results to ensure data quality.

* ***Safety.*** Our data does not overlap with any existing MLLM benchmark, minimizing *the risk of data leakage*. Additionally, our annotations do not rely on any models, thus *avoiding model biases*. With over $30$ annotators, including several with professional knowledge backgrounds, we ensure that our dataset has no significant personal biases.

* ***Difficulty and Distinguishability.*** The dataset's challenges are mainly in the following aspects: (1) *Performance*. Even the most advanced model has not exceeded $55\%$ accuracy in basic perception tasks, with reasoning tasks being even more difficult. (2) *Distinguishability.* There are significant differences between models, with a clear gap between earlier works like LLaVA and more advanced recent models. (3) *Computation*. Due to the high resolution of the selected images, some models exhibit very slow processing speeds, thus our data also poses computational efficiency challenges.
   
* ***MME-RealWorld-CN.*** Existing Chinese benchmark ([liu2023mmbench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06281)) is usually translated from its English version. This has two problems: 

   (1) *Question-image mismatch.* The image may relate to an English scene, which is not intuitively connected to a Chinese question.

    (2) *Translation mismatch* ([tang2024mtvqa](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11985)), where machine translation is not precise and perfect enough. 

    We collect additional images and ensure that all images focus on Chinese scenarios, asking Chinese workers for annotation. This results in $5,917$ QA pairs.

<!-- In the quest for artificial general intelligence, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements, but their potential in processing sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored. We introduce <strong>MME-RealWorld</strong>, the first-ever full-spectrum, <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>M</strong>odal <strong>E</strong>valuation benchmark of MLLMs in <strong>Video</strong> analysis. It is designed to comprehensively assess the capabilities of MLLMs in processing video data, covering a wide range of visual domains, temporal durations, and data modalities. MME-RealWorld comprises **900 videos** with a total of 254 hours, and **2,700 human-annotated question-answer pairs**. Our work distinguishes from existing benchmarks through four key features: 
* *Duration in temporal dimension*. Encompassing both **short- (< 2min)**, **medium- (4min\~15min)**, and **long-term (30min\~60min)** videos, ranging from **11 seconds to 1 hour**, for robust contextual dynamics;
* *Diversity in video types*. Spanning **6 primary visual domains**, i.e., Knowledge, Film & Television, Sports Competition, Life Record, and Multilingual, with **30 subfields** to ensure broad scenario generalizability;
* *Breadth in data modalities*. Integrating multi-modal inputs besides video frames, including **subtitles and audios**, to assess the all-round capabilities of MLLMs;
* *Quality in annotations*. **All data are newly collected and annotated by humans, not from any existing video dataset**, ensuring diversity and quality.  -->

## üîÆ Evaluation Pipeline
<!-- üìç **Extract Frames and Subtitles**:

we select or collect **13,366** high-quality images from more than **300,000** public images and internet sources. The selected images have an average resolution of **1,734 √ó 1,734**, containing
rich image details and presenting more challenges for recognition.

With respect to the setting of adding subtitles, you should only use the subtitles corresponding to the sampled video frames.
For example, if you extract 10 frames per video for evaluation, take the 10 subtitles that corresponding to the time of those 10 frames.

If you have already prepared the video and subtitle file, you could refer to [this script](https://github.com/look4u-ok/video-slicer) to extract the frames and corresponding subtitles. -->
